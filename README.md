# Commusify
Commusify - A music service truly connected to it's community.
## About
This was a school project at BBZW Sursee. The task was to show that one can master object-oriented programming. I hope I was able to do that with this project as I personally love programming :). Commusify (= Community + Music) is a console application where users can log in and listen to music. But you can also pretend to be an artist and listen to tracks yourself. I have mapped some logic from reality.
## Database
Commusify was built using Transact SQL (Microsoft SQL Server).

#### phpMyAdmin Version (MySQL)
I converted the database to a MySQL database so I also have phpMyAdmin's ERD, which has the advantage that you can see exactly which table columns are referenced.
